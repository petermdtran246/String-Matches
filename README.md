# String Matches

## Description:
This program defines a function called matches that takes two strings as arguments and returns the number of matches between the strings. A match is defined as having the same character at the same index in both strings. The program then prompts the user to input two words, converts them to lowercase, and calls the matches function to print the number of matches between the two words.
